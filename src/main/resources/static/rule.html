                <li>4. the results of all applications will be displayed in our membership system and calculated in a standardized way. You can request the results to be audited within three days after the display. Three days later, we will not accept any request.</li>

                <li>6. if you use any illegal means or malicious submission of a large number of duplicated unqualified links for rewards, the LOTS team reserves the right to disqualify you from our plan and retrieve all the rewards you may have received before.</li>
                <li>7. any published content shall not contain ETH address or require other personnel to transfer accounts. Otherwise, you will no longer be eligible to participate in the plan.</li>

                <li>11. the Bounty is divided into three phases. After each stage, your score will be recorded and cleared. In the next stage, everyone is on the same starting line. We hope not to lose heart in the previous stage and continue to work hard. In the selection of the annual awards, we will record the total score recorded in three stages. In order to award prizes.</li>
                <li>12. the LOTS team reserves the right to final decision and interpretation of the LOTS-Bounty plan, and will explain the activity rules at the appropriate time.</li>
